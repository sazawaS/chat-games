This is my second ever project in web development. 

Goals of this project:
1) Make a user login/register system (complete 2024-10-28)
2) Make a global messaging system (complete 2024-10-28)
3) Make a rooms system, where only two people can talk with each other (in progress) 
4) Make the rooms system a game.
5) Make the UI actually likeable.

What I've learnt so far:
1) a basic knowledege of sessions (this kinda reminds me of roblox development, where I did similar server-side session management)
2) a basic knowledege of sockets (this reminds me of godot's emit function)

Resources:
1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-handle-sessions-in-express/ (Geeks for geeks provides very straight-to-the point articles, they're very good and resourcefull)
2) The mongoose docs https://mongoosejs.com/docs/7.x/index.html (I ran into countless mongoose errors and had to google everywhere. I found most of the solution in these docs.
3) Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYGhoHW7zqI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgsQrOHNKeY) I watched a few other vids on sessions but they were not very resourcefull.
